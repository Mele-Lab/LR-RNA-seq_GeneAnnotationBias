MissingOutputException in rule first_split in file /gpfs/projects/bsc83/Projects/pantranscriptome/pclavell/ONT_preprocessing/scripts/snakemake/Snakefile, line 120:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 120 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/split/mock1_sample1
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
